This is the reconstruction verification code which is used to administer this project's [integration database](https://github.com/SeaAroundUs/integration-database).
And since the integration database is the data hub for authoring domain and fact data, the data managed by this tool would subsequently make it way to the public
www.seaaroundus.org site.

Also see /notes/reqs.txt for the original requirement doc that was created to initiate development of this tool.
